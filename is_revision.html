                <h2>Chapter 1: Concepts of Systems and Information</h2>
                
                <h3>What is a System?</h3>
                <p>A system is a structured and organized set of interrelated components that work together in a coordinated manner to achieve a specific goal or purpose. The components are interdependent, meaning a failure in one can affect the entire system's performance.</p>
                
                <h3>Characteristics of Systems</h3>
                <p>Systems have several key features: components (each with a specific role), interrelationships (how parts connect), boundaries (defining the system's scope), inputs and outputs, feedback mechanisms (for self-regulation), and a defined goal or purpose.</p>
                
                <h3>Components of a System</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Input:</strong> Raw materials, resources, or data received from the environment</li>
                    <li><strong>Process:</strong> The internal mechanisms that convert inputs into outputs</li>
                    <li><strong>Output:</strong> The results produced after processing (e.g., products, services, or reports)</li>
                    <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Information about performance used for monitoring and improvement</li>
                    <li><strong>Control:</strong> Policies and tools that ensure the system operates according to standards</li>
                    <li><strong>Environment:</strong> External factors (market, regulations) that interact with the system</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Open vs. Closed Systems</h3>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Open systems</strong> actively interact with the environment, exchange resources, and are highly adaptive and dynamic (e.g., businesses, universities).</p>
                    <p><strong>Closed systems</strong> operate independently with minimal environmental interaction and are rigid and predictable (e.g., isolated mechanical devices).</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Data vs. Information</h3>
                <p>Data refers to raw, unprocessed facts (like numbers or symbols) that lack meaning on their own. Information is data that has been processed, organized, or interpreted to provide meaning and support decision-making.</p>
                
                <h3>Characteristics of Data</h3>
                <p>Data is discrete, objective, raw, and often voluminous and context-independent.</p>
                
                <h3>Characteristics of Information</h3>
                <p>Information is contextually relevant, accurate, timely, and action-oriented.</p>
                
                <h3>What is an Information System?</h3>
                <p>A coordinated arrangement of people, processes, and technology that works to capture, process, store, and disseminate information to support organizational goals.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 2: Overview of Information Systems</h2>
                
                <h3>Why Information Systems Matter</h3>
                <p>Information systems are vital for enhancing efficiency, supporting decision-making, enabling innovation and growth, strengthening stakeholder relationships, and gaining a competitive advantage.</p>
                
                <h3>Core Components</h3>
                <p>Every information system consists of five parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Physical devices</li>
                    <li><strong>Software:</strong> Programs</li>
                    <li><strong>Data:</strong> The lifeblood/raw facts</li>
                    <li><strong>People:</strong> Users and specialists</li>
                    <li><strong>Processes:</strong> Workflows and rules</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Integration of Components</h3>
                <p>These components are interdependent. Hardware and software provide the foundation, data provides content, people drive usage, and processes ensure alignment with organizational objectives.</p>
                
                <h3>Types of Information Systems</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Transaction Processing Systems (TPS):</strong> Handle routine, day-to-day operations like payroll or sales</li>
                    <li><strong>Management Information Systems (MIS):</strong> Provide structured, summarized reports for middle management</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision Support Systems (DSS):</strong> Assist in complex, non-routine decision-making using analytical models</li>
                    <li><strong>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP):</strong> Centralized platforms that integrate all department processes into one database</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
